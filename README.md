# space-game

Ideas/todo

goals:
gravity
shoot stuff like asteroids
get blown up by asteroids if they hit you
other ships
-- steal their stuff
star system map
moving with player's perspective


game play loop:
start somewhere with items like fuel/ammo (unlimited/energy weapons?)
--fuel meter
--refueling needs to be implemented


what components do we need:
* space ship
* star system
* object in space (static): i.e. planets and stuff that doesnt move
* moving objects in space (asteroids, other ships)
* projectiles
* space ship related items
* movement by arrow keys
* thrust to move forward, rotate to change directions

prioritization of components:
* space ship
* star system
* movement
* everything else listed above
