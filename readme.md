**Summary (flavorful):**
"*StarBoys: An Adventure Across Time*" (project name: space-game) is a 2D 'top-down' asteroids-inspired game built in C++.
The player controls an unidentified space-faring craft of rectangular construction that is equipped with a plethora of VX-plasma thrusters, enabling the ship to turn and propel itself in the vacuum of space. Due to the frictionless nature of the void the player must be careful when engaging their thrusters, lest they overcorrect and spin carelessly into a nearby piece of space debris. Such a collision will doubtlessly rupture the pseudo-newtonian plasma containment and cause the instantaneous birth of a small dwarf star. Such unstable fuel is needed to explore the deep reaches of space, however, as it is the key to interstellar hyperspace travel. To aid in the players exploration, his craft is armed with a forward-facing point defense system. This unguided slower-than-light plasma torpedo is meant to aid in the destruction of errant asteroids and clearing possible obstructions, but would prove effective against any manner of target in a pinch. The player is tasked with the exploration of unknown space, his motivations are his own...

**Summary (bland):**
Space-game gives the player control of a small ship. They are able to rotate and propel themselves around the screen. There is no friction so they must control their speed and angular momentum in order to pilot the ship safely. Asteroids are spawned randomly around the screen, and can be destroyed by firing your weapon at them. Colliding directly with an asteroid will end the game. Colliding with the edge of the screen will initiate travel to a new screen, with a fresh batch of asteroids. The game opens on a start menu, with the options to read the instructions or begin playing. The other screens include the gameplay area with ship/asteroids, the hyperspace screen, the instructions screen (which can be accessed at any time), and the end screen (which presents the player with the option to try again).

**Goal:**
Explore! Destroy! Be Destroyed! Repeat!

**Directions:**
* Left and right arrow keys control rotation.
* Up arrow accelerates in the direction the rocket is facing.
* Space bar fires ship weaponry.
* H to access help menu.
* Enter to return to game.

**Keys:**
* Left/Right/Up arrow keys (as above)
* Space bar (as above)
* H/Enter (as above)

**Mouse interaction:**
Most buttons are clickable (On start menu, help menu, and end screen). Buttons typically serve to transition between screens.

**Inspiration?:**
We loved the idea of a small sandbox game in which the player can jet around in space and shoot some asteroids as stress relief. One of our team members had some starter code for a similar concept from earlier projects, but that code served mostly as a conceptual starting point upon which we built a completely new product.
